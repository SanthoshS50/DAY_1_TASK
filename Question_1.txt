Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP :-
        HTTP Stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
        
        By using this HTTP User can Send Request to the Server & Server send the Response to the User.

        There are Several Stages of HTTP are there, HTTP1.1 which was created in 1997 & HTTP2 was created in 2015.

HTTP1.1 :-

        It works on the Textual Format.

        There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it, until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.

        It Compresses Data itself.

        HTTP1.1 only allows one Request & Response to be sent at a Time.

        In TLS Encryption, HTTPS is Optional in HTTP1.1

        

HTTP2 :-

        It works on Binary Protocol.

        It allows multiplexing, so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

        It Uses HPACK to Compress the Data.

        HTTP2 allows Multiple Request & Response to be sent over a Single Connection.

        In TLS Encryption, HTTPS is Mandatory in HTTP2.
