Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects and its Internal Representation in Javascript:-

        In Javascript, Objects are Fundamental Data type used to Store and Organize the Data.

        Objects are Different than Primitive Datatypes

        It is a Collection of Key value pairs, where the keys are String and the values can be any Datatype, including other Objects.

        Objects are used to Represent Complex Data Structures and can be Created in various ways.

        An object can be created with figure brackets {} with an optional list of properties. 
        
        A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is the property name value can be anything.


Internal Representation :-

        Internally, objects are typically implemented using hash tables or similar data structures. 

        Each key is hashed to provide quick access to the corresponding value.

        This allows for efficient lookup and insertion of properties.


There are Three ways to Create Objects in Javascript : 

        1. By Object Literal:

            object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN}  

        2. By creating instant of Object directly:

            var objectname=new Object();  

        3. By using an Object Constructor:

            Here we need to Create function with arguments. Each argument value can be assigned in the current object by using this keyword.
